## Kernel source

https://github.com/mytja/android_kernel_samsung_a53x/tree/twrp-12.1

## How to obtain dtb/dtbo and kernel modules?
Download the latest AP file for your device, then extract `recovery.img`, use Android Image Kitchen to `unpackimg.sh`.

You should be able to find DTB & DTBO inside `split_img` folder as `recovery.img-dtb` and `recovery.img-recovery_dtbo`.

Everything in `recovery/root` can be found inside the `ramdisk` folder, as generated by Android Image Kitchen.

## How to build

This device tree was tested and is fully compatible with [minimal-manifest-twrp](https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_aosp).

1. Set up the build environment following the instructions [here](https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_aosp/blob/twrp-12.1/README.md#getting-started).

2. In the root folder of the fetched repo, clone the device tree:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mytja/android_device_samsung_a53x.git -b main device/samsung/a53x
```

```sh
export ALLOW_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES=true
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch twrp_a53x-eng
mka recoveryimage
```
